I designed this keyboard completely from scratch (which may have been a mistake but oh well), this is what it should look like: https://imgur.com/a/Zq8FCIB

I've omitted keys that I never use, which may be stupid, so that there are less keys to worry about. That being said, I truly have no idea what I'm doing, and am making this keyboard because I like learning new things and it's very fun.

My discord is liamdt06 feel free to reach out with questions or anything, but unfortunately I cannot promise I'll have the answer
